STE - Installation from sources
================================================================================

Building in Linux
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the sources from the STE website (ste-[version]-src.zip).

2. Unpack the archive into the temporary directory (i.e. /tmp/ste).
	Lets name it further STE_ROOT.

3. Make sure that gcc package is installed.

4. Make sure that the following development packages are installed:
	- libqt4 >= 4.6.0
	- libiconv >= 1.9 (can be found in cxxtools package as well)
	- libenca >= 1.13

5. (Optional) You can additionally install the following packages:
	- astyle >= 1.24
    - csstidy
    - htmltidy (can be named just as 'tidy' as well)

6. (Optional) For any libraries which are not in the default path, open the
	STE_ROOT/ste.pro file and fix appropriate path(es) in the unix
	section.

7. Go to STE_ROOT and type in the console:
	qmake
	make

	(or, open the ste.pro file in the Qt Creator & perform the build).

	This will start building of STE. If there were no errors, you should get
	ste file in the STE_ROOT directory.

8. Type in the console:
	sudo make install

	You will be prompted for the root password. Afterwards, this will install
	STE into the system.



Building in Windows
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the sources from the STE website (ste-[version]-src.zip).

2. Unpack the archive into the temporary directory (i.e. c:/tmp/ste).
	Lets name it further STE_ROOT.

3. Make sure that MinGW32 package is installed.

4. Make sure that the following development packages are installed:
	- Qt >= 4.6.0
	- iconv >= 1.9

	By default, it is expected that these packages are put into
	../STE_ROOT/Libs directory, but you can have them everywhere you wish. In
	this case, please follow p.5.

5. (Optional) For any libraries which are not in ../STE_ROOT/Libs directory,
	open the STE_ROOT/ste.pro file and fix appropriate path(es) in the
	win32 section.

6. Go to STE_ROOT and type in the console:
	qmake
	mingw32-make

	(or, open the ste.pro file in the Qt Creator & perform the build).

	This will start building of STE. If there were no errors, you should get
	ste.exe file in the STE_ROOT/bin directory.



Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: While building, I'm getting errors like:

stylemanager.o: In function `StyleManager::doCreateLexer(int)':
stylemanager.cpp:(.text+0x2f4b): undefined reference to `QsciLexerASM::QsciLexerASM(QObject*)'
stylemanager.cpp:(.text+0x36e9): undefined reference to `QsciLexerNSIS::QsciLexerNSIS(QObject*)'
...

A: You should remove or disable any previous Qscintilla installations before the
build.
